# Herdle : Modular & Open Communication stack for Virtual Collaboration

## Objective:

This proposal outlines the development of a unified communication platform combining [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) for chat, [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/) for video calls, and [Mumble](https://www.mumble.info/) for audio communication. This platform will enable customized collaboration spaces, support various use cases such as **presentations**, **networking meetings**, and **coworking simulations**, ecosystem that allows third-party developers to create bots, plugins, and tools over it, focusing on extensibility, flexibility, and empowering communities to build custom functionality.

## Overview of the Idea

### Problem Statement

Current virtual collaboration platforms lack flexibility in switching between communication services, handling fluctuating bandwidth, and adapting to different user needs (e.g., presentations, social events, immersive audio). Moreover, they offer limited customization and developer integration capabilities. These platforms lack the openness and modularity required for a developer-focused ecosystem where third-party tools, bots, and customizations are integral to the user communication experience.

### Proposed Solution

We propose to build a unified communication platform that brings together:

**- Matrix** for decentralized and encrypted text communication.  
**- Jitsi** for high-quality, secure video conferencing.  
**- Mumble** for low-latency, real-time voice communication with a plugin system.

This platform will allow users and developers to fully customize the experience, from the interface to communication flows. The key distinction is the focus on an ecosystem development platform, enabling third-party developers to create and integrate plugins, bots, and custom tools. The platform will also support plugin-based real-time audio interactions through Mumble's flexible plugin framework. Users and organizations will be able to tailor the platform to their needs—whether it's for communities, enterprise communication, or specialized use cases (e.g., game servers, developer teams, social hubs).

## Key Features and Implementation Overview

- **Modular Framework**
- **Custom Collaboration Settings:**
  - **Audio Simulations** with **Mumble** for coworking spaces or virtual events with spatial sound.
  - **Presentation Mode**: Allow presenters to pre-upload files, transmitting only navigation commands (e.g., slide changes) to reduce bandwidth and improve presentation quality.
  - **Video Call Configurations**: Options for networking events, presentations, and casual video chats with adaptable features.
- **Developer-Friendly Ecosystem:** A robust plugin architecture with API access, enabling developers to create tools, bots, and plugins for custom use cases.
  For e.g.

  - Mumble will be integrated through its **[plugin system](https://www.mumble.info/documentation/developer/positional-audio/create-plugin/guide/)**, allowing Rust-based interaction with the Mumble C API using Foreign Function Interface (FFI). The integration will allow:

    - **Custom voice control:** Move users between channels, adjust settings, and enable custom actions based on events.
    - **Plugin management:** Users can install, enable, or disable plugins that modify the voice experience, such as AFK detection, automated channel movements, or game integrations.

  - Support community-driven extensions via a plugin marketplace and one click install architecture.
  - **Custom communication flows**: Design workflows that automatically trigger when users join channels, send messages, or start calls.
  - **Bot automations and custom integrations**: Build intelligent bots that moderate, manage users, and integrate with external services (e.g., GitHub, CI/CD systems, Jira, or Google Workspace.).

- **Security, Moderation, and Permissions**

  Ensuring a safe environment for users and developers is key:

  - **Granular permissions:** Allow different levels of access control for users, bots, and plugins.
  - **Moderation tools:** Built-in tools for banning, reporting, and managing content.
  - **OAuth and authentication:** Secure authentication protocols to ensure that only authorized users and bots interact with sensitive data.

## Benefits of the Platform

### a. Unified Communication

Combining Matrix, Jitsi, and Mumble offers users a single platform for all types of communication: text, voice, and video. The modular architecture ensures flexibility across various user scenarios, from business collaboration to social gaming communities.

### b. Openness and Extensibility

The platform’s developer-first approach means that developers can extend the platform without restrictions, building custom bots, plugins, or integrations tailored to their needs. This openness encourages innovation and flexibility, setting it apart from closed platforms like Discord or Slack.

### c. Decentralized and Secure

By leveraging Matrix’s federated architecture, users benefit from decentralized communication, enabling greater privacy and data control. Additionally, Jitsi and Mumble are open-source and can be self-hosted, ensuring that organizations can maintain full control over their infrastructure.

### d. Scalable and Adaptable

The platform is built to be scalable for large communities, with Jitsi’s Videobridge providing capacity for many video calls and Mumble handling large voice chat rooms. The modular design allows us to adapt to various industries (e.g., gaming, enterprise collaboration, online communities).

### e. Community-Driven Development

The ecosystem encourages a community-driven development model where developers and users can contribute to the platform, building tools that address niche needs or enhance general functionality. This creates an organic, self-sustaining ecosystem. 

## Conclusion and Next Steps

This platform represents a modular, developer-friendly communication solution tailored for dynamic virtual collaboration. With pluggable services, customizable settings, and an open ecosystem for developers, it delivers a highly flexible and efficient platform suitable for coworking, presentations, and virtual networking.
